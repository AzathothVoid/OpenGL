# OpenGL
This is where I will upload all OpenGL code that I have written, or will ever write. This is meant to be a diary for my journey on learning my side-hobby of learning game development from scratch.


NOTE:- All the programs that i have written will require the GLFW Library, glad and glfw headers in order to call the neccessary OpenGL functions.
